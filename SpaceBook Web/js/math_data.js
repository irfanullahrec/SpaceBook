        "theory": "The word 'matrices' is plural of the word 'matrix'. The term matrix was first introduced by the mathematician Arthur Cayley in 1860. The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various areas of Mathematics. It has widely been used in the fields of pure mathematics, statistics, engineering and physical and social sciences. Thus, matrix theory finds an important place in modern age and has become an integral part of mathematics.\n\nMatrices make presentation of numbers clearer and make calculations easier. The following table presents the information about a series of hockey matches played between Pakistan and India:\n\n| Match Record | Played | Won | Drawn | Lost |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Pakistan** | 8 | 4 | 1 | 3 |\n| **India** | 8 | 3 | 1 | 4 |\n\nThe information is readily available when presented in this way. For example, if we want to know how many matches India lost against Pakistan, we go along the row 'India' and column 'Lost' and find that it is 4. Similarly, if we want to know how many matches Pakistan drew with India, we go along the row 'Pakistan' and column 'Drawn' and find that it is 1. As long as we remember what each number represents, we could remove the row and column headings and write just the numbers, enclosing them in square brackets or parentheses:\nA = [[8, 4, 1, 3], [8, 3, 1, 4]]\nThus A is a matrix.\n\n• 1.1.1 Matrix:\nA matrix is a rectangular array (arrangement) of real numbers enclosed in square brackets. Each number in a matrix is called an element or entry of the matrix. For example:\n[[2, 3], [6, 5]] and [[3, 4, 2], [-1, 1, -2], [-4, -3, -5]] are all matrices.\nIn the matrix [[2, 3], [6, 5]], the numbers 2, 3, 6, 5 are the elements or entries of the matrix. Matrices are frequently denoted by capital letters such as A, B, C and so on.\n\n• 1.1.2 Rows and Columns of a Matrix:\nThe rows of a matrix run horizontally, and the columns of a matrix run vertically.\nFor example, consider matrix A:\nA = [[4, 3, -2], [1, 5, 2], [3, 1, 1]]\n- The numbers 4, 3, -2 run horizontally, so they constitute the first row (Row 1).\n- The numbers 1, 5, 2 run horizontally, so they constitute the second row (Row 2).\n- The numbers 3, 1, 1 run horizontally, so they constitute the third row (Row 3).\n- The numbers 4, 1, 3 run vertically, so they constitute the first column (Column 1).\n- The numbers 3, 5, 1 run vertically, so they constitute the second column (Column 2).\n- The numbers -2, 2, 1 run vertically, so they constitute the third column (Column 3).\n\n• 1.1.3 Order (or Dimension / Size) of a Matrix:\nA matrix with m rows and n columns has order m × n (read 'm by n').\nIf a matrix has order m × n, then m represents the number of rows and n represents the number of columns.\nFor example:\nA = [[2, -3, 2], [1, 3, -4]] has 2 rows and 3 columns. Order of A = 2-by-3 (or 2 × 3).\nB = [[1, 2], [1, 3]] has 2 rows and 2 columns. Order of B = 2-by-2 (or 2 × 2).\n*Tid-Bit:* Order of a matrix m × n does not mean to multiply m and n.\n\n• 1.1.4 Equality of Two Matrices:\nTwo given matrices A and B are said to be equal if:\n(i) Both the matrices are of the same order (they respectively have the same number of rows and columns).\n(ii) The elements in the corresponding positions in A and B are equal.\nFor example:\n[[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]] and [[1, 1+1, 12/4], [4+2, 10/2, 8/2]] are equal matrices.\nWhereas [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] and [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]] are NOT equal matrices because their orders are different (3×2 ≠ 2×3).",

          "Order is written as Rows-by-Columns (m × n), never Columns-by-Rows.",

        "title": "1.2 Types of Matrices",
        "theory": "The textbook defines and classifies matrices into the following key types:\n\na) Row-matrix:\nA matrix which has just one and only one row in it is called a Row-matrix.\nFor example, the matrices [a, b], [1, 3, 4], and [2, 4, 6, 8] are all row-matrices.\n\nb) Column-matrix:\nA matrix which has just one and only one column in it is called a Column-matrix.\nFor example, [[2], [1], [4], [3]] and [[b], [6], [5], [8]] are all column matrices.\n\nc) Square-matrix:\nA matrix in which the number of rows and columns are equal is called a square matrix.\nFor example, [[m, n], [n, p]] has 2 rows and 2 columns, so it is a 2-square matrix.\nThe matrix [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [-1, -4, 2]] is a square matrix of order 3 (3-square matrix).\nAs a special case, the matrix consisting of a single element [3] is a square matrix of order 1 (1-square matrix).\n\nd) Rectangular-matrix:\nA matrix whose number of rows and number of columns are not equal is called a rectangular matrix.\nFor example, [[a, b, c], [d, e, f]] has rows = 2, columns = 3 (2 ≠ 3), so it is a rectangular matrix.\nSimilarly, [[1, 4], [3, 2], [5, -3]] has order 3-by-2, so it is a rectangular matrix.\n\ne) Zero matrix or Null matrix:\nAny matrix (whether rectangular or square) of which all the elements (entries) are equal to zero is said to be a Zero matrix or Null matrix, denoted by O.\nFor example:\nO_2x2 = [[0, 0], [0, 0]] is a null matrix of order 2.\nO_2x3 = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] is a null matrix of order 2-by-3.\n*Important Points:*\n1. A zero matrix is not necessarily a square matrix.\n2. The role of zero matrix in matrix operations is similar to zero in arithmetic (A + O = A).\n\nf) Diagonal matrix:\nA square matrix in which all elements are zero except the diagonal elements is known as a diagonal matrix.\nThe Main Diagonal starts at the top left and goes to the bottom right.\nFor example:\nA = [[1, 0], [0, 3]] is a diagonal matrix of order 2.\nB = [[2, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0], [0, 0, -5]] is a diagonal matrix of order 3.\n\ng) Scalar matrix:\nA diagonal matrix in which all the diagonal elements are equal non-zero constants is said to be a scalar matrix.\nFor instance: [[7, 0], [0, 7]] and [[1/2, 0, 0], [0, 1/2, 0], [0, 0, 1/2]] are scalar matrices of order 2 and 3 respectively.\n*Note:* Every scalar matrix is a diagonal matrix, but every diagonal matrix is not necessarily a scalar matrix.\n\nh) Identity matrix (Unit matrix):\nThe identity matrix is a square matrix denoted by I in which all elements on its main diagonal are 1's and all other elements are zero:\nI_2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\nI_3 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\ni) Transpose of a matrix:\nThe matrix obtained by interchanging mutually the rows and columns in A is called the transpose of A and is denoted by A^t (or A').\nFor example, if A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], then A^t = [[1, 3], [2, 4]].\n\nj) Symmetric matrix:\nA square matrix A is said to be symmetric if the transpose of A is equal to A itself, i.e., A^t = A.\nFor example, if A = [[1, 2], [2, 4]], then A^t = [[1, 2], [2, 4]] = A. Thus A is symmetric.\nSimilarly, B = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]] has B^t = B, so B is symmetric.\n\nk) Skew-Symmetric matrix:\nA given square matrix A is said to be Skew-Symmetric if A^t = -A.\nFor example, if A = [[0, -3], [3, 0]], then A^t = [[0, 3], [-3, 0]] = -[[0, -3], [3, 0]] = -A.\nTherefore, A is a skew-symmetric matrix. All diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric matrix must be 0.",

If C is 2-by-3 and D is 3-by-2, they are NOT conformable.\n\n• 1.3.2 Addition and Subtraction Operations:\n- Addition: The sum A + B is obtained by adding corresponding elements of matrices A and B:\n  (A + B)_ij = a_ij + b_ij.\n  Example: [[3, 8], [4, 6]] + [[4, 0], [1, -9]] = [[3+4, 8+0], [4+1, 6-9]] = [[7, 8], [5, -3]].\n- Subtraction: The difference A - B is obtained by subtracting each element of B from the corresponding element of A:\n  (A - B)_ij = a_ij - b_ij.\n  Example: [[3, 8], [4, 6]] - [[4, 0], [1, -9]] = [[3-4, 8-0], [4-1, 6-(-9)]] = [[-1, 8], [3, 15]].\n\n• 1.3.3 Multiplication of a Matrix by a Real Number (Scalar Multiplication):\nLet A be any matrix and k be any real number. The matrix obtained by multiplying each element of A by k is called the scalar multiplication of A by k, denoted by kA:\n(kA)_ij = k · a_ij.\n\n• 1.3.4 Commutative and Associative Laws under Addition:\n- Commutative Law: If A and B are matrices of the same order, then A + B = B + A.\n- Associative Law: If A, B, and C are matrices of the same order, then A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.\n\n• 1.3.5 Additive Identity of Matrices:\nIn matrix theory, the Zero matrix O serves as the additive identity:\nA + O = O + A = A.\n\n• 1.3.6 Additive Inverse of a Matrix:\nIf A and B are two matrices of the same order such that A + B = O = B + A, then B is called the additive inverse of A (and B = -A):\nA + (-A) = (-A) + A = O.",

Scientific notation provides a concise and precise standard method for expressing such quantities.\n\n• Standard Form:\nA positive number $x$ is said to be in scientific notation if it is expressed in the form:\n$$x = a \\times 10^n$$\nwhere $1 \\le a < 10$ and $n$ is an integer (positive, negative, or zero).\n\n• Rules for Determining the Exponent $n$:\n1. If the decimal point is shifted to the left by $n$ places, the exponent of 10 is $+n$.\n2. If the decimal point is shifted to the right by $n$ places, the exponent of 10 is $-n$.\n3. If the number is already between 1 and 10 ($1 \\le a < 10$), $n = 0$ ($10^0 = 1$).\n\n• 3.1.2 Converting Scientific Notation to Standard Decimal Notation:\nTo convert $a \\times 10^n$ to ordinary decimal form, shift the decimal point in $a$ by $|n|$ places to the right if $n > 0$, or to the left if $n < 0$, inserting zeros as placeholders where necessary."

Symbolically:\n$$a^x = y \\iff x = \\log_a y$$\nHere, $a$ is the base, $y$ is the argument ($y > 0$), and $x$ is the logarithmic value.\n\n• Two Fundamental Identities:\n1. $\\log_a 1 = 0$ (since $a^0 = 1$ for any $a > 0, a \\ne 1$)\n2. $\\log_a a = 1$ (since $a^1 = a$)\n\n• Domain and Constraints:\nLogarithms of negative numbers and zero are undefined in the set of real numbers because a positive base raised to any real power is always strictly positive ($a^x > 0$)."

When the base is 10, it is usually omitted: $\\log_{10} x = \\log x$.\n\n• 3.3.2 Natural Logarithm (Napierian Logarithm):\nLogarithms computed with base $e$ (where $e \\approx 2.71828...$ is Euler's number) are called Natural Logarithms, discovered by John Napier. Denoted by $\\ln x = \\log_e x$.\n\n• 3.3.3 Characteristic and Mantissa:\nThe common logarithm of any positive number consists of two parts:\n$$\\log x = \\text{Characteristic} + \\text{Mantissa}$$\n1. Characteristic: The integer part of the logarithm (can be positive, zero, or negative). If negative, it is written with a bar over it (e.g., $\\bar{2}.4512$).\n   - For numbers $\\ge 1$, $\\text{Characteristic} = (\\text{number of integral digits}) - 1$.\n   - For numbers $< 1$, $\\text{Characteristic} = -(\\text{number of zeros immediately after decimal point} + 1)$.\n2. Mantissa: The positive fractional or decimal part ($0 \\le \\text{Mantissa} < 1$). It is obtained from the 4-figure logarithm tables and is independent of the position of the decimal point.\n\n• 3.3.4 Anti-Logarithm:\nThe number whose logarithm is given is called its Anti-logarithm.

Addition & Subtraction:\nTo add or subtract rational expressions:\n- Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators.\n- Express each rational expression with the common denominator (LCM).\n- Add or subtract the numerators and simplify the resulting fraction to lowest terms.\n  P/Q ± R/Q = (P ± R) / Q\n  P/Q ± R/S = (P·S ± Q·R) / (Q·S)\n\n2. Multiplication:\nTo multiply rational expressions:\n- Multiply numerators together and denominators together:\n  (P/Q) · (R/S) = (P·R) / (Q·S)\n- Factorize and cancel all common factors before multiplying to simplify the work.\n\n3. Division:\nTo divide one rational expression by another, invert the divisor (take its reciprocal) and multiply:\n  (P/Q) ÷ (R/S) = (P/Q) · (S/R) = (P·S) / (Q·R), where R ≠ 0, S ≠ 0, Q ≠ 0.",

The H.C.F is the product of all common factors taken with their lowest exponents.\n- Method of Division: Useful for polynomials of higher degree where factorization is difficult. Divide the polynomial of higher degree by that of lower degree. If degrees are equal, either may be chosen as dividend.

Clear Fractions: If the equation contains fractions, multiply both sides by the LCM of all denominators.\n2. Remove Parentheses: Use the distributive property a(b + c) = ab + ac to expand any brackets.\n3. Collect Like Terms: Simplify both sides separately.\n4.

Divide by Coefficient: Divide both sides by the non-zero coefficient of the variable to isolate x.\n6. Check / Verification: Substitute the obtained value back into the original equation. If LHS = RHS, the solution is verified.\n\n• Important Principles of Equality:\n- An equation remains balanced when equal numbers are added to both sides.\n- An equation remains balanced when equal numbers are subtracted from both sides.\n- An equation remains balanced when both sides are multiplied by the same non-zero number.\n- An equation remains balanced when both sides are divided by the same non-zero number.",
